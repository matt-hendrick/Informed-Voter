# Informed Voter

[Informer Voter](https://informedvoter-ef786.web.app) is a web app that interacts with the Google Civic Information API and the ProPublic Congress API to provide the user with a variety of relevant civic information. The user can query a list of their national, state, and local represenatives, view Senate and House members lists, view recent bills, recent votes, and view voting information specific to their address.

Informer Voter was built with React 17.0.1.

// This was one of the earlier React apps that I built.
